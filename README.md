# DARUMA-binding

DARUMA-binding is a prediction tool for identifying binding sites in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antepontem/DARUMA-binding.git
cd DARUMA-binding
```

PyTorch must be installed separately according to your operating system and CUDA environment.

After installing PyTorch, install the remaining dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

DARUMA-binding takes a FASTA file containing one or more amino acid sequences and predicts residue-level binding sites.

Example:

```bash
python src/daruma_binding/predict.py -i input.fasta -o output.txt
```

Arguments:

- `-i`: Input FASTA file containing one or more amino acid sequences.
- `-o`: Output file path.

See the `examples/` directory for example input files and execution examples.

## Input

Input sequences must be provided in FASTA format.

A FASTA file may contain one or more amino acid sequences.

## Output

For each input sequence, DARUMA-binding outputs the following information:

1. Accession / FASTA header
2. Amino acid sequence
3. Binding probability for each residue
4. Binary binding prediction for each residue (`1`: binding, `0`: non-binding; threshold = 0.26)
5. Predicted pLDDT
6. Predicted relative solvent accessibility (RSA)
7. Predicted three-state secondary structure (SS3; `H`: helix, `S`: strand, `C`: coil)
8. Predicted eight-state secondary structure (SS8)

In addition to binding predictions, DARUMA-binding outputs predicted structural features used by the model.
